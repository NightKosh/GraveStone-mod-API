# This is an API for [Gravestone mod - Graves](https://github.com/NightKosh/GraveStone-mod)

Using this API you can:
- prevent graves generation on mob death
- place additional items in grave on mob death(from your custom slots or any another source)
- prevent some items to be placed in grave
- generate grave on your own mob death
- allows to use your swords as gravestones
- allows to change position of grave on death


I'm highly recommend you to use this API in your project as [git submodule](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Submodules)
